# TODO What are conditionnal statements 
# Every computer language I have ever used has had at least one conditional statement. 
# Most of the time that statement is the if/elif/else structure. 
# This is what Python has. Other languages also include the case/switch statement 
# which I personally enjoy, however Python does not include it. 
# You can make your own if you really want to, but this book is focused on learning Python fundamentals, 
# so we’re going to be only focusing on what’s included with Python in this chapter.

# The conditional statement checks to see if a statement is True or False. 
# That’s really all it does. However we will also be looking at the following Boolean operations: 
# and, or, and not. These operations can change the behaviour of the conditional in simple and complex ways, depending on your project.
